# Insurance Claims Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to **predict insurance both regression and classification claims**. The goal is to help insurance companies **assess risks, detect potential fraudulent claims, optimize underwriting decisions, and prepare for future claim volumes**.

By leveraging classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning techniques, and model interpretability tools such as **SHAP** and **LIME**, this project demonstrates how AI can improve decision-making in the insurance industry.
